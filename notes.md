Below you can find some of my unpublished notes,
which I thought would be worth posting here,
since I could not find these topics clearly
covered in open publications.

<a href="/resources/pdf/akuz_popt_cost.pdf">Portfolio Optimization with Trading Cost</a><br />
Andrey Kuzmenko, 9 March 2014, Research Note.

<a href="/resources/pdf/akuz_lda_asym.pdf">Gibbs Sampling for LDA with Asymmetric Dirichlet Priors</a><br />
