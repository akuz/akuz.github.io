I am an applied mathematician, software engineer, quantitative analyst, experienced with- and interested in Machine Learning (ML), especially Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM), Bayesian Inference and Learning, and Deep Neural Networks (Conv, LSTM, GAN, etc). I currently actively use C++ and Python, but also have a lot of experience with Java, C, C#, JavaScript, SQL. I can learn program in any language, not a problem (during my long life I've even programmed in ASP, Perl, Pascal/Delphi, ColdFusion, and other long forgotten languages). My favourite application areas are natural language processing (NLP), quantitative finance (QF), computer vision (CV) and, more recently, automatic music generation, among others.
