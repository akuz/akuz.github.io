It has two convolutional layers, with convolutions of size 4 and strides of 2, with ReLU nonlinearities. This results in 1/4 frame rate of the original audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stereo Autoencoder" src="http://akuz.me/images/StereoAutoencoder.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corresponding deconvolutions are then applied. The network is trained using the Adam algorithm using batches of 100 audio segments of 1024 stereo samples each. This only takes a few seconds, when training on the random batches extracted from the same song, and the parameters converge after 150 iterations. The animation below shows how the ability of the network to encode a random sample of music changes with training, during all 150 iterations (the gif is looped on itself backwards). Notice how it learns the mono features first, and then adjusts them to approximate the stereo music better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stereo Autoencoder 1" src="http://akuz.me/images/StereoAutoencoder1.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course does not result in any compression because, even though we reduced the frame rate to 1/4 of the original, we now have 64 channels per sample versus the original 2 channel stereo. This gave me an interesting idea that with enough structure extracted in the features trained on a single song (or an artist), it might be possible to achieve a very high compression ratio — I am sure somebody is already working on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see below 3 more gifs (+15 Mb to your traffic) with some further comments on the ability of the above autoencoder to approximate the music with 64 features at 1/4 of the original frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stereo Autoencoder 2" src="http://akuz.me/images/StereoAutoencoder2.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above gif shows a more or less regular frequency superposition. Notice small imperfections in approximating sharp corners, resulting from having only 64 features in the narrowest autoencoder layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stereo Autoencoder 3" src="http://akuz.me/images/StereoAutoencoder3.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above gif shows that low frequencies are aproximated rather well. Also, you can see interesting artefacts at the edges of the segment — the network does not have enough “power” to push the approximation away from zero, because the output neurons there receive inputs from the fewer number of inner neurons, because I used ‘SAME’ convolution mode in TensorFlow (this can be fixed with a simple adjustment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stereo Autoencoder 4" src="http://akuz.me/images/StereoAutoencoder4.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the above gif shows that the aproximation is not very good with very high frequencies. Of course, this is because there are only 64 features, and moreover each of them has a field of view of 8 audio samples (which is quite wide). It is an interesting question whether the higher frequencies should be approximated at the expense of having more features, or possibly, a special “noise” feature could be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a Jupyter Notebook with my code &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/akuz/0039b1d4c5ee261634bc7b294ef33c35"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to run it, since it uses some of my audio preprecessing. Anyway, at least you can see my sloppy TensorFlow model, if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>LDA vs Document Clustering</title><link href="http://akuz.me/lda-vs-document-clustering.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>akuz</name></author><id>tag:akuz.me,2014-03-29:/lda-vs-document-clustering.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was asked at the interview what’s the difference between LDA and document clustering.

I tried to explain it by explaining the difference between generative models that are assumed for the respective models. However, now I realise it would have been much more effective to give a much simpler example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bread Data" src="http://akuz.me/images/Bread_Data.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a dataset of objects that you can broadly classify as “plain bread” and “bread with seeds”. For this example, it is important that these objects share some similarity, but also have important differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the document clustering approach, if you had a model that would need to group these objects into 2 clusters, then you would end up with the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bread Cluster" src="http://akuz.me/images/Bread_Cluster.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the LDA approach you would not be inferring the document clusters. Instead, you would be inferring the “ingredients” of the objects, i.e. what they consist of. By running the LDA on our dataset you would end up with the following result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bread Ingredient" src="http://akuz.me/images/Bread_Ingredient.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would also get a probability of each ingredient in each object (document).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Release 0-0-2</title><link href="http://akuz.me/release-0-0-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>akuz</name></author><id>tag:akuz.me,2014-01-30:/release-0-0-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Released version 0.0.2 of the Java source code.

We will investigate the topic structure of the corpus, by gradually “freezing” the topics through specifying their keywords, and seeing what other topics come up. The process shows how you can extract useful topics from your corpus, such that these topics would provide a meaningful basis for topic detection in future articles.&lt;/p&gt;

.0374 police     .0353 protesters .0180 killed     .0155 charged

.0110 officer    .0108 anti       .0096 kiev       .0090 street
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Limitations: 10,000 new articles represent approximately only 2 days of news from 400 top world newspapers and blogs. Therefore, the topic structure will be highly biased to the events reported during this period. Also, I will only use 250 Gibbs sampling iterations after burn in to infer the topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of the configuration parameters are provided in the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file of the of &lt;code&gt;akuz-java-nlp-run-lda&lt;/code&gt; package from the &lt;code&gt;akuz-java&lt;/code&gt; library. Please see the &lt;a href="http://akuz.me/pages/software.html"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; page for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we run &lt;code&gt;akuz-java-nlp-run-lda.sh&lt;/code&gt; with the following topics config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[
  {
    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;proportion&amp;quot;: 0.5
  },
  {
    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;count&amp;quot;: 20,
    &amp;quot;proportion&amp;quot;: 0.025
  }
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With this config, we specify that we want to extract one topic with a very high proportion, in order to extract a topic that would cover a lot of frequent words, which are not stop words. We assign smaller proportions to other 20 topics, so they would capture less wide spread topics (both across the documents and words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top words for the first "noise" topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the complete list of topics &lt;a href="http://akuz.me/txt/topics_2.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you might find it interesting that the inference has brought up additional high-probability words into the us_gov and protests topics. This might be a useful feature in itself, if your goal is to see what words are correlated (within a topic) with the keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, specification of the "frozen" topics (through keywords) lets the algorithm to separate the other topics more clearly. For example, we might see that even though we have allocated the whole topic to us_gov (which mainly concentrated in the international issues), we can see that an additional topic about US healthcare has come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now dedicate a new topic to US healthcare in configuration. Additionally, let’s specify another topic to capture the words related to the film industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can detect the following issues now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;us_gov topic mixes the news about the US and the UK &amp;mdash; so we want to introduce new topic for UK government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;film topic mixes the news about the movies, sports and music, mostly because they mention similar words about celebrities &amp;mdash; so we want to split these topics too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the complete list of topics &lt;a href="http://akuz.me/txt/topics_4.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we now obtain topics that are very relevant to the keywords that we specified. By providing the keywords, we also helped the algorithm to separate the topics that would be hard to separate without the hints. For example, the words “star” and “play” use used in many different topics, as well as the word “government”, which originally caused topics bundling, but were unwound once we specified the additional keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now we can see that us_gov topic got mixed up with a topic about corporations, where they frequently mention the word “president” too. We can now proceed by creating a dedicated topic for “president company conference call”, and then continue our research further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post demonstrated the process of research that you can use
to extract "useful" topics from a corpus of texts. The "usefulness"
is defined as you knowing what "the topic is about" because you
specify the keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This iterative process is useful in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to find other words correlated with the keywords you are interested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to produce meaningful topics that would be useful for detection in the new articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided that you use a corpus large enough (as it is not the
case with the current study), you can infer very generic topics,
that would provide a lot of correlated words in addition to the
keywords you specify. The richness of thus inferred topics allows
detecting them with a high precision in the future unseen documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Simulated Annealing" src="http://akuz.me/images/SimAnn2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to initialise the Dirichlet priors with relatively high parameters alpha, and then gradually decrease them during burn-in period. This will allod the sampler to locate the approximate area of interest faster at the initial stages, while still sampling at the target prior values after burn-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article describes application of simulated annealing technique for MCMC inference of multinomial random distributions with Dirichlet priors in LDA. It is implemented in my NLP library for optimised Gibbs sampling for LDA (see software).

This means that a-priori we assume that all topics are equally likely to appear within each document, and all words are equally likely to appear within each topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we want to pre-configure the topics, before seeing any data, to have some higher priority words or be more likely to appear within each document (more common topics), then one of the approaches would be to specify the asymmetric Dirichlet priors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss one of the approaches of how to do it in a reasonable way in the later posts. Bus for now, we need to understand if the same Gibbs sampling formulae apply for the model with asymmetric priors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, I’ve repeated the derivation of the Gibbs sampling formulae for the case of the asymmetric priors in LDA. The paper can be found &lt;a href="http://akuz.me/pdfs/akuz_lda_asym.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
