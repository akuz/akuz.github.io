  Hey there! This is a personal website of Andrey Kuzmenko. Opinions expressed here do not represent in any way those of my current or past employers. 
</p>

I am an applied mathematician, software engineer, quantitative analyst, experienced with- and interested in Machine Learning (ML), especially Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and Bayesian Inference and Learning. I can program in any language ;) I currently actively use Scala, Java, Python, and C++. I am experimenting with Apache Spark, it's awesome! My favourite application areas are natural language processing (NLP) and quantitative finance (QF), among others.

Thanks for reading!
