title: Simulated Annealing for Dirichlet Priors and LDA
---

This article describes application of simulated annealing technique for MCMC inference of multinomial random distributions with Dirichlet priors. It is employed in my NLP library for optimised Gibbs sampling for LDA (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}software">software</a>).
