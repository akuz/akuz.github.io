title: Release v.0.0.1
---

The first version of the source code and the binaries for running the optimised LDA Gibbs sampling has been released. Please see software page.

Update: Fix 1 has now been released. ThreadCount was incorrectly used instead of TopicCount in \\( \alpha \\) and \\( \beta \\) configuration objects.

Please click the link below to see the 20 topics output produced from 10,000 news articles, after running just 200 iterations. First 100 iterations are burn-in with temperature from 1.0 to 0.1, and then 100 sampling iterations at temperature 0.1. It was completed in 15 seconds on a 4-core machine.
